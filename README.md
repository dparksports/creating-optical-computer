# Q & A
1. What is an optical computer?

- A modern desktop computer has about 5 TFLOPS (5 x 10^16 floating calculations per second).  
- With an optical computer, there is no limit in the calcuations per second. 

2. Is an optical computer faster than a quantuam computer?

- In 2016, the fastest known quantum computer has 2000 qubits, which is 1000 faster than 512 qubits.
- With an optical computer, there is no artificial limitation like 2000 or 500 qubits.

3. What's the theoretical compute limit on an optical computer?
- There is a limit of speed of light.
- For now, the only artificial limitation is how we design the first prototype.

4. How much energy does it use?
- The first POC should use less than 1000 W/hr.

5. Has there been any prior inventions or work being done?
- There are some filed in the patents.
- They can't really be constructed in real sense.

6. Can we construct it now?
- Yes

7. How much time does it require?
- Depends on the funding.

8. How many people do we need?
- After first constructing the first POC, we will need to scale it for mass production.  For that, we will need help of others.

9. Will you patent it?
- Yes

10. Will you open-source it?
- Maybe*

11. Why hasn't anyone else done it?
- In hindsight, everything is 20/20.

12. How does it work?
- It uses the properties of a photon to deliever infinite compute capability.

13. Will it use the current state of Silicon chip fabrication?
- First prototype will use chips, but in the future, we will probably have less dependency on chips.
- It's a new technology.

14. What are the limitations of the first POC?
- Like the first POC, it will be limited by the construction of the first design.
- These limitations will be removed by re-iterating the design of an optical computer.

15. What can we do with an optical computer?
- One of the advantages is an optical computer doesn't require much energy to deliver the infinite compute capability.

16. Can you provide few examples, where the infinite compute capability of an optical computer may be helpful?
- One example is AGI, the General AI, the holygrail of AI, which will require vast amount of compute capabilty.
- But we discovered that we can easily make an optical computer running on one watt (1 watt).

17. What can we do with one-watt optical computer?
- It will be one-watt optical computer with vast compute performance.
- Imagine it is embedded in Apple Glasses, for example.
- It will enable the compute hungry wearable devices, while enabling the Apple Glasses to last days, not few hours, on a single charge.
- Applications are limited by only our imagination.

17. How long have you been working on this?
- This idea has been with me for some time.
- Our technology isn't ready.
- We discovered ways to overcome the limitations of the current state of technologies.
