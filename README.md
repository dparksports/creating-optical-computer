Notes of Creating an optical computer.

#Q & A
1. What is an optical computer?

- A modern desktop computer has about 5 TFLOPS (5 x 10^16 floating calculations per second).  
- With an optical computer, there is no limit in the calcuations per second. 

2. Is an optical computer faster than a quantuam computer?

- In 2016, the fastest known quantum computer has 2000 qubits, which is 1000 faster than 512 qubits.
- With an optical computer, there is no artificial limitation like 2000 or 500 qubits.

3. What's the theoretical compute limit on an optical computer?
- There is no theoretical limitation.
- e only artificial limitation is how we design the first prototype, but its limit can be easily removed on the next version of the prototype.

4. How much electricity energy does it require?
- The first POC should use less than 1000 W/hr.
- For the first prototype, we should be able to construct it to use less than that of a typical household refrgierator.

5. Has there been any prior inventions or work being done?
- There are some filed in the past.
- There were limited by our current state of art technologies.
- And, they can't be constructed in real sense.

6. Can we construct it now?
- Yes

7. How much time does it require?
- Depends on the funding.

8. How many people do we need?
- After first constructing the first POC, we will need to scale it for mass production.  For that, we will need help of other people to mass produce it and distribute it.

9. Will you patent it?
- Yes

10. Will you open-source it?
- Maybe*

11. Why hasn't anyone else done it?
- In hindsight, everything is 20/20.

12. How does it work?
- It uses the properties of a photon to deliever infinite compute capability.

13. Will it use the current state of Silicon chip fabrication?
- Probably not. 
- It's a new technology.

14. What are the limitations of the first POC?
- Like the first POC, it will be limited by the construction of the first design.
- These limitations will be removed by re-iterating the design of an optical computer.

15. What can we do with an optical computer?
- One of the advantages is an optical computer doesn't require much energy to deliver the compute capability.

16. Can you provide few examples, where an optical computer may be helpful?
- We can design an optical computer which can run on one watt (1w/hr) with superior compute performance.
- This can be embedded in Apple Glasses, for example, to enable the compute hungry wearable devices, while masking the Apple Glasses to last days, not few hours, on a single charge.
- Another example is AGI embedded within a comsumer product.
- AGI is General AI, the holygrail of AI.

17. How long have you been working on this?
- This idea has been with me for some time.
- Our technology isn't ready.
- I solved these limitations to overcome the limitations of the SOTA technologies.
